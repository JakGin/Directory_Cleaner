# Directory_Cleaner

This is a python program to organize your files in directory.
When you run this program in the directory you want to clean up 
all the files in that directory with some extensions (.txt .jpg etc.)
will be moved to newly created directories named after the extensions 
(for example jpg files will be moved to directory named "jpg directory",
txt files will be moved to directory named "txt directory" etc. )
